      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I enjoy explaining the mysteries of the human condition in simple words.
        I like to help people all over the world feel understood, confront their
        joys and pains, and be motivated to change. All this gives me energy
        when I wake up in the morning.
        <br />
        The modern ideology of love is compelling. Never before has the couple
        been such a central unit in our social organization. Never have we
        expected more from our intimate relationships, and never have we
        crumbled under the weight of so many expectations. Couples therapy is
        probably the hardest type of therapy to be in and to practice; and I
        have been on both sides.
        <br />
        In my work as a therapist, I see despair, entrenched patterns,
        loneliness in the presence of another, contempt, violence, lack of any
        physical touch; so many couples come to me way beyond their due date. I
        learn, daily, how to master the art of couple therapy. I continually
        study neuroscience, attachment theory, neuro-linguistic programming, and
        psychodrama. The great thing about being a therapist is that I
        don&apos;t have to worry about age-ism and boredom. It&apos;s not like
        keeping up with technology: as long as my brain works, I can practice
        until I drop â€” and I certainly intend to. Thanks for reading my story.
